# Pixel Paws

Pixel Paws is a simple web application that simulates the care of virtual pets. Users can interact with pixelated pets, feed them treats, and monitor their hunger levels. The project demonstrates the usage of classes in JavaScript to manage the behavior and attributes of each pet instance.

## Features

-   Allows users to select and interact with virtual pets.
-   Displays the saturation level of each pet to indicate their hunger status.
-   Provides treats for users to feed their pets, increasing their saturation levels.
-   Updates the display in real-time as pets are fed or their hunger levels decrease.
-   Utilizes a responsive layout for optimal viewing across different devices.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Select a pet by clicking on its container in the pet container area.
3. Feed the selected pet by clicking on the available treats in the treat container area.
4. Monitor the saturation level of each pet to ensure they are well-fed and happy.
5. Observe the pet's message and opacity change if their saturation level drops to zero.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

## Files Included
